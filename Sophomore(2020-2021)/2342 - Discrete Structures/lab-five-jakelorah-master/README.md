# CSC2342-01 F20 Lab Five
## Dr. Jason M. Pittman

## Purpose
The purpose of this work is to implement a program to test whether a given positive integer is prime or composite.

## Requirements
Your program, at a minimum, must include the following features. Be certain to submit your assignment in Blackboard$^1$ after you are finished programming *and* testing.

## Features
   The minimum features are as follows. I recommend programming to each successive feature and testing it before moving on.

   1. Ask the user to input a positive integer.
   2. Compute whether the input value is composite or prime.  
       Note: you can take a shortcut in your algorithm by using modular arithmetic. I am expecting you to take this shortcut!
   3. Output the decision.

## Rubric
The grading rubric for this lab is as follows. You can construct your testing procedures based on the rubric, FYI.

   1. Does the program compile or run without error?
   2. Does the program present me with instructions??
   3. Does the program generate valid sequences?
