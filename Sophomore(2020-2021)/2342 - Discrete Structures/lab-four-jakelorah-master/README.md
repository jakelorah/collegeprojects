# CSC2342-01 F20 Lab Four
## Dr. Jason M. Pittman

## Purpose
The purpose of this work is to implement a simple sequence generator.

## Requirements
Your program, at a minimum, must include the following features. Be certain to submit your assignment in Blackboard$^1$ after you are finished programming *and* testing.

## Features
   The minimum features are as follows. I recommend programming to each successive feature and testing it before moving on.

   1. Ask the user to input the first term (a<sub>1</sub>)
   2. Ask the user to input the number of terms in the sequence.  
       Note: Do not allow *infinite*. There must be a value.
   3. Ask the user to input the generator rule (e.g. 3n - 1)  
   4. Output the full and correct sequence.

## Rubric
The grading rubric for this lab is as follows. You can construct your testing procedures based on the rubric, FYI.

   1. Does the program compile or run without error?
   2. Does the program present me with instructions??
   3. Does the program generate valid sequences?
