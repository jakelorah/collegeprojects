# CSC2342-01 F20 Lab Seven
## Dr. Jason M. Pittman

## Purpose
The purpose of this work is to develop a program to compute discrete probabilities using coin flips.

## Requirements
Your program, at a minimum, must include the following features. Be certain to submit your assignment after you are finished programming *and* testing.

## Features
   The minimum features are as follows. I recommend programming to each successive feature and testing it before moving on.

   1. Build a function whereby the program flips a coin and returns 0 for *heads* and 1 for *tails*  
   2. Ask the user how many times the coin should be flipped.
   3. Ask the user how many of those flips should come up *heads*.  
       Note: we assume the remaining flips are *tails*.
   4. Calculate and output the correct probability in both E/S and % formats.
       
## Rubric
The grading rubric for this lab is as follows. You can construct your testing procedures based on the rubric, FYI.

   1. Does the program indicate the desired grade / work level (see 2a and 3b)  
   2. Does the program compile or run without error?
   2. Does the program present me with instructions??
   3. Does the program generate valid sequences?
