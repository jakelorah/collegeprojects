# CSC2342-01 F20 Lab Six
## Dr. Jason M. Pittman

## Purpose
The purpose of this work is to implement a program to test whether a given positive integer is prime or composite.

## Requirements
Your program, at a minimum, must include the following features. Be certain to submit your assignment after you are finished programming *and* testing.

## Features
   The minimum features are as follows. I recommend programming to each successive feature and testing it before moving on.

   1. Ask the user whether order of output values matters.  
   2. If order does not matter, implement logic such that the program:  
       a. takes two (C level), three (B level), or more than 3 (A level) sets of inputs  
       b. outputs the solution using the *sum rule* and the *product rule* (each labeled as such).   
   3. If order does matter, implement logic such that the program:
       a. takes one set of inputs and a second value (which can be zero!) as the size of the subset  
       b. outputs the solution of *P(n)* (C level) or *P(n, r)* (B,A levels) depending on the second value in 3a.  

## Rubric
The grading rubric for this lab is as follows. You can construct your testing procedures based on the rubric, FYI.

   1. Does the program indicate the desired grade / work level (see 2a and 3b)  
   2. Does the program compile or run without error?
   2. Does the program present me with instructions??
   3. Does the program generate valid sequences?
